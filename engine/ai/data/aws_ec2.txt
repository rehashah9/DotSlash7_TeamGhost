About EC2 Instances in AWS:
The AWS EC2 Instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. It provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud, eliminating the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. With EC2, you can launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage.
