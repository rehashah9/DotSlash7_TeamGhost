Table: aws_ec2_instance - Query AWS EC2 Instances using SQL

About Table :The AWS EC2 Instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. It provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud, eliminating the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. With EC2, you can launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage.

Table Usage Guide: The aws_ec2_instance table in Steampipe provides you with information about EC2 Instances within AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). This table allows you, as a DevOps engineer, to query instance-specific details, including instance state, launch time, instance type, and associated metadata. You can utilize this table to gather insights on instances, such as instances with specific tags, instances in a specific state, instances of a specific type, and more. The schema outlines the various attributes of the EC2 instance for you, including the instance ID, instance state, instance type, and associated tags.

Examples for SQL Queries & their Use Case for Table: 

Query Name: Instance count in each availability zone
